# Example configuration for peakachu_cohort

# Optional: Base directory for all outputs. If not specified, a default
# 'peakachu_cohort_outputs' directory will be created in the current working directory.
# Can be overridden by the --output-dir CLI option.
# output_dir: /path/to/your/analysis/output

# Required: Resolutions to process (e.g., 5000 for 5kb, 10000 for 10kb)
resolutions:
  - 5000
  - 10000

# Required: Define samples and their Hi-C data paths.
# Sample names should be unique identifiers.
samples:
  sample_A_rep1:
    path: /path/to/data/sample_A_rep1.mcool # or .hic
    group: condition_A # Optional: Assign sample to a group for differential analysis
  sample_A_rep2:
    path: /path/to/data/sample_A_rep2.mcool
    group: condition_A
  sample_B_rep1:
    path: /path/to/data/sample_B_rep1.mcool
    group: condition_B
  sample_B_rep2:
    path: /path/to/data/sample_B_rep2.mcool
    group: condition_B

# Optional: Define groups explicitly if not using the 'group' key under samples.
# Useful if samples belong to multiple groups or for complex experimental designs.
# groups:
#   condition_A:
#     - sample_A_rep1
#     - sample_A_rep2
#   condition_B:
#     - sample_B_rep1
#     - sample_B_rep2

# Optional: Path to a BED file containing CTCF binding sites for annotation.
# ctcf_bed_path: /path/to/annotations/encode_ctcf.bed

# Optional: Logging configuration
logging:
  # Logging level for the application. Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR.
  # CLI verbosity flags (-v, -vv) take precedence if more verbose.
  level: INFO
  # Optional: Path to a file where logs should be written.
  # If specified, logs will go to both the console and this file.
  # The file path is relative to the main output directory's 'logs' subfolder
  # unless an absolute path is given.
  # file: run.log

# --- Add more specific configuration sections for modules as needed ---
# e.g., peakachu_train_params, diff_analysis_settings, etc.
